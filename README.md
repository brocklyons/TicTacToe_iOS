# Tic Tac Toe for iOS

My first iOS app to be submitted to the app store officially, which utilizes SwiftUI for building out all the visuals.


## To do...
- [X] Create the game screen
- [X] Implement logic for selecting spaces and making moves
- [X] Implement end-game logic for winning or losing and allowing the player to play again
- [X] Create main menu skeleton for launching either single or dual player games
- [X] Add and implement back to main menu button from the current game screen
- [X] Change Player 2 win highlighting to purple instead of red
- [X] Implement UX changes for dual player
- [X] Create and implement "dumb" AI for single player that takes the first available space
- [X] Improve "dumb" AI to be semi-smart by checking for a space that will win it the game first or if it could block a player from winning
- [X] Highlight winning or losing sequence of spaces in green/red on end-game
- [X] Exclude iPad as a supported device for this app (only support iPhone)
- [X] Create an app icon
- [X] Polish main menu with custom title image
- [X] Create and add custom X and O images
- [ ] Add some sound effects into the game
- [ ] Go through any final things to get the app ready to submit (probably need to do a EULA thing somewhere on my personal site.)
